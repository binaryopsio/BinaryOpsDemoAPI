# BinaryOpsDemoAPI
This repository is a sample for [BinaryOps.io](https://binaryops.io). It contains the files
you'd have on your local machine when developing your Backend API using Binaryops.

In order to work with an API on BinaryOps from your local machine, you;ll need to install the cli from the [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/binaryops):

`npm install -g binaryops`

Please note that the cli is still in beta, it will check for version updates and let you know when you need to install a new version.
